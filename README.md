This color flipper application is original by John Smilga. Check out his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/codingaddict The code for both the html file and the js file was written by me for practice. The file "styles.css" was copied from the project repository. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&amp;t=2631s&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
